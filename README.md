# AI-Powered Smart Bluetooth Connection Manager ‚Äì Technical Documentation

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Smart Bluetooth Connection Manager** is a cross-platform application designed to intelligently manage Bluetooth connections between mobile devices (Android/iOS) and desktops/laptops (Linux/Windows/Mac). It leverages AI to predict connection behavior, sync notifications, manage device profiles, and enable seamless file transfers. The system automates pairing, disconnection, and profile switching based on user habits, location, and device proximity.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a client-server model, with a mobile agent on the phone and a desktop application as the central hub. Communication occurs over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Classic, with AI-driven decision-making for connection management and user behavior prediction.

## üîç AI Functionality

### 1. **Disconnection Prediction**

- **Model**: Logistic Regression for simple predictions, LSTM for time-series RSSI trends.
- **Input Features**:
  - RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
  - Device battery levels
  - Time of day
  - Environmental factors (e.g., Wi-Fi interference, location)
- **Output**: Probability of disconnection within the next 5 minutes.
- **Training Data**: Historical RSSI logs, user connection patterns.

```python
# Example: Logistic Regression for disconnection prediction
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample training data: [RSSI, battery, hour_of_day]
X_train = np.array([[75, 80, 14], [65, 50, 18], [80, 90, 9]])
y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # 0: stay connected, 1: disconnect
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict disconnection probability
proba = model.predict_proba([[70, 60, 15]])  # Example input
```

### 2. **User Profile Detection**

- **Profiles**: Home, Office, Traveling
- **Detection Criteria**:
  - Wi-Fi SSID (e.g., "Home-WiFi", "Office-Net")
  - Time of day (e.g., 9 AM‚Äì5 PM for Office)
  - GPS location (mobile only, coarse location for iOS)
- **Actions**:
  - Auto-mute notifications during meetings
  - Enable/disable sync based on profile
  - Restrict file access for specific profiles

```python
# Example: Profile detection logic
def detect_profile(wifi_ssid, hour, gps_coords):
    if wifi_ssid == "Home-WiFi" and 18 <= hour <= 23:
        return "Home"
    elif wifi_ssid == "Office-Net" and 9 <= hour <= 17:
        return "Office"
    elif gps_coords and abs(gps_coords[0]) > 0.1:  # Moving
        return "Traveling"
    return "Default"
```

### iOS Limitations
- BLE only (no Classic Bluetooth for file transfers).
- Limited notification access due to iOS sandboxing.
- File transfers via iCloud Drive or BLE GATT (slower).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

- **Encryption**: AES-256 for file transfers and notification data over GATT.
- **Device Trust**: Pairing requires a one-time token exchange.
- **Access Control**: File transfers and notifications restricted to trusted devices.
- **User Approval**: File transfer requests prompt user confirmation on both devices.

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Voice Commands**: Integrate voice control (e.g., ‚ÄúSend file to laptop‚Äù) using local speech recognition.
- **Cloud Fallback**: Use local Wi-Fi or WebSocket for long-range sync when Bluetooth is unavailable.
- **Device Locator**: Add ‚Äúring my device‚Äù feature for lost phones/laptops.
- **App Integration**: Sync notifications from Microsoft Teams, Slack, or other apps.
- **Federated Learning**: Improve AI models with anonymized user behavior data across devices.
